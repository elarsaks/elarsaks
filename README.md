I started writing code in 2015, while still doing my degree in Business Administration at Helsinki Business College. I started by
modifying web page templates and I just got fascinated about design.

My interest in digital media took me to Haaga-Helia to study Business Information Technology. Although I started loving
design and aesthetics, the more code I wrote, the more addicted I got to the problem-solving aspect of it. I started
Haaga-Helia, wanting to be a web designer and ended it wanting to be a full stack developer.

Now that I have my first half a year of industry experience under my belt, I would love to master my skills as a full-stack
developer and then move on towards data engineering. 

I just built out my portfolio as a full-stack JavaScript developer and will take some time now to work on my hobby projects before adding some more technologies to my stack.
